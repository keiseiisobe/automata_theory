# Computability and Algorithms

### Computability

**Computability** refers to the ability to solve a problem in an effective manner using an algorithm. In the context of theoretical computer science and mathematics, a problem is considered "computable" if there exists an algorithm that can solve it for all valid inputs in a finite amount of time [1]. The concept of computability is formalized by models of computation such as Turing machines. If a problem cannot be solved by any algorithm, it is deemed "uncomputable" or "undecidable" [2]. The most famous example of an uncomputable problem is the Halting Problem, which asks whether a given program will finish running or continue forever [3].

### Algorithm

An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined, unambiguous, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation [4]. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures that take an input, perform a sequence of computational steps, and produce an output. They must be finite (terminate after a finite number of steps), deterministic (produce the same output for the same input every time), and effective (each step must be sufficiently basic to be executable) [5]. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used in virtually every aspect of computing, from data processing and calculations to artificial intelligence and machine learning.
