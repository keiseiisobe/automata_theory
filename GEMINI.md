# Introduction to Automata Theory

Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and problems they are able to solve. This field is a foundational pillar of theoretical computer science, providing the mathematical framework for understanding computation.

## Core Concepts
- **Automaton**: An abstract self-propelled computing device that follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically.
- **Formal Language**: A set of strings of symbols that might be generated by a formal grammar.
- **Computability**: What problems can be solved by an automaton.
- **Complexity**: How efficiently problems can be solved.

## Relationship with Other Subjects

Automata theory has deep connections with various other disciplines:

### Computer Science
- **Compiler Design**: Finite automata are used in lexical analysis.
- **Operating Systems**: State machines model process states and transitions.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Concepts of state-space search and planning relate to automata.
- **Programming Languages**: Formal grammars (like Context-Free Grammars) are used to define the syntax of programming languages.

### Mathematics
- **Logic**: Automata are used to model decision procedures for various logics.
- **Algebra**: Algebraic structures are often used to describe properties of automata and languages.
- **Graph Theory**: Automata can be represented as graphs (state diagrams).

### Linguistics
- **Natural Language Processing**: Formal grammars are essential for parsing and understanding human languages.

## Document Standards

To ensure the credibility and verifiability of information, all new documents added to this collection must include references to the evidence used. This is primarily done by providing URLs to the source materials, research papers, or authoritative web pages that support the statements and facts presented.

**Rule:** For every significant claim, definition, or historical fact, a corresponding URL reference (or other verifiable source) must be provided, typically at the end of the sentence or paragraph where the information is presented.
